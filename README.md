## 🎨 Project Structure

The project is organized with a clean and scalable structure:

```
/
├── components/         # Reusable components
│   ├── sections/       # Main page sections (Hero, Skills, etc.)
│   └── three/          # 3D models and canvases
├── public/             # Static assets (images, videos, fonts)
├── app/                # Next.js App Router pages and layout
└── lib/                # Utility functions
```

## 🌟 Key Highlights

### The Hero Section

A stunning, full-screen hero section with a looping video background, 3D model, and dynamic text. I've optimized the video by compressing it from **63MB to under 5MB** using FFmpeg, ensuring fast load times.

### The Skills Section

A unique, interactive 7x7 grid of "skill cards" inspired by Pokemon cards. On hover, the cards enlarge and reveal the full design, while other cards blur out. This was built from scratch with Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

### Mobile Responsiveness

I've taken a mobile-first approach to ensure the portfolio is fully responsive. Every section, from the hero to the skills grid, adapts beautifully to different screen sizes.
